# Simple navigation app using TomTom SDK

*Note: Navigation SDK for Android is only available upon request. [Contact us](https://developer.tomtom.com/tomtom-sdk-for-android/request-access "Contact us") to get started.*

This example shows how to build a simple navigation application using the TomTom Navigation SDK for Android.
The application displays a map and shows the userâ€™s location. After the user selects a destination with a long click, the app plans a route and draws it on the map. Navigation is started once the user taps on the route.

For further explanations on the example provided can be found in this [tutorial](https://developer.tomtom.com/android/navigation/documentation/use-cases/build-a-navigation-app).

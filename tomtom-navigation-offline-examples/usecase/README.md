This example shows how to build a simple offline navigation application using the TomTom Navigation SDK for Android.
The application displays an empty map first, automatically downloads the tiles around the user location and shows the
userâ€™s location. After the user selects a destination with a long click, the app plans a route and draws it on the map.
Navigation is started once the user taps on the route.
